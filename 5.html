      <h2>Warning</h2>
      <div style="text-align: left">
      <p>
     Make sure the third party site that sells the computer parts are reliable. Some sites will scam the user and send fake or third party parts. For example if you are buying from Ebay sometimes people will send fake parts instead. You should check on the user information and  any comments mentioned about them. If the comments mentions many negative infomation then avoid buying.  Also if the price of the CPU you want to buy seems too good to be true then it would be best to avoid it. Reddit or other forums will show people talking about where to shop and will include good suggestions with purchases.
