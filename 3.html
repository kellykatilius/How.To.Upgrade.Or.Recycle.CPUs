    <h2>More Power to The Computer</h2>

    <p>Overtime computers will slow down. An old cpu will start up slower and process slower.  While a new cpu will allow more programs to be running and without experiencing any slows. Even when powering up the computer it will feel faster than before.

    <h2>Enhanced Graphics</h2>
    <div style="text-align: left">

      <p>More cpus now own a built in dedicated graphics card. With the built in graphics card it will show better graphics than before. If you already have a dedicated graphic card that is separate from the cpu then it will not much of a benefit.  However, in case your old graphic card breaks down, having one on the cpu benefits you. Furthermore the new cpu will offer better graphics than the old cpu.

  <h2>Longer Lifespan</h2>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        <p>
By replacing a new cpu to the computer it can improve the lifespan of the computer. With the new cpu the system fan will cool better and prevent too much heat in the rest of the hardware. The old cpu can still do that but not as effective since worn down over time. It will also improve the energy efficiency. Meaning more battery life for the computer and lower power consumption.
