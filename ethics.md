Open source allows creaters to re-use components of code to develop more code, with greater functionality and speed. In maintaining usage of our open source project developers that contribute, collaborate, or obtain open-source code must keep in mind ethical considerations. This includes checking for bias, accuracy of information, avoiding exclusion, crediting collaborators, and sharing code or finished projects in return. Our goal is to grow a heathly community around our open-source project as well as to encourage creators and maintainers to adopt inclusive behaviors. We would also like our users and developers to abide by our additional ethical priciple, sustainability. With our manual, we strive to be extremely eco-friendly through the act of recycling, and we do so along with valuing efficiency. Second, we believe in having respect for every user of our manual, no matter their background, as discussed in the Inclusivity Statement. Lastly, we believe in the right to confidentiality. Users deserve to keep whatever information they please private. By understanding this open-source code of conduct, ethical practices will be implemented throughout the manual.
