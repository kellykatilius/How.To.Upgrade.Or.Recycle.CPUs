    <h2>Reasons</h2>
    <p>The reason for wanting to upgrade a CPU or processor varies for everyone. Asking yourself questions as well as doing research will help you determine whether upgrading your cpu provides benefits. <br><br> If you are unfamiliar with any terms used on this page, please refer to the <a href="7.html">General Defintions</a> page. </p>

  <h2>What Functions Do You Use Your Computer For? </h2>
  <p> Consider what functions you use your computer for. Are you using CPU intensive applications such as editing, video, and gaming software, or are you using it for day-to-day functions? What are your power requirements for personal or work use? You must consider why exactly you want to upgrade your CPU and whether the cost of a new CPU is worth the performance gain. </p>
  <h2>How Long Have You Have Your Computer? </h2>
  <p>With relatively new CPUs, it should be fine for the most part and wouldn't need to be upgraded. But with a CPU aged 5-10+ years old there could be benefits to upgrading it, but this depends if the performance affects the functionality of the computer.</p>
  <h2>Evaluate Your CPU Performance. </h2>
  <p> Slow performance could be caused by other issues like old thermal paste, a loose or broken CPU cooler, or outdated BIOS settings. Additionally, there are practical reasons for upgrading a computer with sufficient performance. If you are unsure about the performance, and whether your CPU causes the poor performance, it will be helpful to identify this using these steps: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>On Windows 10, click the Start button, then type “about” into the search field. Click on About your PC and the following Window shows up: </li>
    <img src="image/windows.png" alt="view of windows " style="width:45%;" class="center-img">
    <p style="text-align: center"><em>View of Windows "About" settings.</em></p>
    <li>Run CPU Benchmark such as <a href="https://www.cgdirector.com/cinebench-r23-scores-updated-results/">Cinebench R23</a> to compare your CPU’s scores to online database</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If score matches with what others reported your CPU performs to its specifications and your performance problems could be caused by something else </p>
  <h2> Does Your CPU Bottleneck and Limit Your CPU Performance? </h2>
  <p> To check for a bottleneck, you want to run applications and games that you use regularly. To check your CPU’s utilization, you can use Windows Task Manager to monitor your CPU’s utilization: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl- Shift + Esc</b> to open Task Manager, navigate to the ‘Performance’ tab, then select CPU. You should see a graph showing your CPU’s utilization percentage. </li>
    <li>Right-click the graph, hover over ‘change graph to’, and select ‘logical processors’. This should show the utilization of all your CPU’s cores and threads.</li>
    <li>It should be clear if the CPU bottlenecks the rest of the system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The left hand side of Task Manager’s Performance shows CPU utilization. If CPU utilization maxes out most of its core, showing a percentage close to 100%, then you would likely benefit from having a CPU with more cores. </p>
